# first-portfolio-website
This project marks my first foray into web development using HTML and CSS. I created a personal webpage that introduces me and highlights my skills, hobbies, and qualifications. The design features a sleek, responsive navigation bar, a visually appealing background with a gradient overlay, and interactive elements like a search bar and social media icons. The webpage is structured to provide a clear and concise presentation of information, with attention to both aesthetics and functionality. This project helped me solidify my understanding of basic web development principles.
